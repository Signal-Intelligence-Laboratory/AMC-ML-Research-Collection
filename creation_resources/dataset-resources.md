# A Collection of Datasets
### For possible use in testing

[DeepSig](https://www.deepsig.ai/datasets/)
- Contains known errata, better to generate new set
- Used by the RFML repo

[Panoradio SDR](https://panoradio-sdr.de/radio-signal-classification-dataset/)
- HF signal set
- Created by researcher looking into synthetic vs real data

[TorchSig](https://torchsig.readthedocs.io/en/develop/)
- Contains a module for creating datasets

[SPREAD](https://sprite.ccs.neu.edu/datasets/SPREAD/)
- Created by Northeastern researchers for JaX and other projects

[Cyclostationary.blog](https://cyclostationary.blog/data-sets/)
- Created as a challenge for machine learners on the problem of generalization

## Other Dataset Creation Paths
