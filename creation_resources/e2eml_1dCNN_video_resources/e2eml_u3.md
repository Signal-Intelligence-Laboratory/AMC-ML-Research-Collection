# Unit 3 - Build a small convolutional neural network

### 3.1 Create the blips data set
To follow along with the code, navigate to data/data_loader_blips.py and make sure you are on the v19 branch. Or you can use [the GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/brohrer/cottonwood/-/blob/v19/cottonwood/data/data_loader_blips.py).

### 3.2 Collect all the blocks we'll need
You can follow along with cottonwood/examples/convnet/blip_demo.py or [in the GitLab project](https://gitlab.com/brohrer/cottonwood/-/blob/v19/cottonwood/examples/convnet/blip_demo.py).

### 3.3 Connect the bloks into a network structure
*No additional notes*

### 3.4 Training, evaluation, and reporting
*No additional notes*

### 3.5 OneHot and Flatten Blocks and Logging
The OneHot and Flatten blocks are in cottonwood/core/operations.py ([here's the GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/brohrer/cottonwood/-/blob/v19/cottonwood/core/blocks/operations.py)).

The ValueLogger is in cottonwood/core/logger.py ([here's the GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/brohrer/cottonwood/-/blob/v19/cottonwood/core/logger.py) for that one).

### 3.6 Inspect text summary and loss history
*No additional notes*

### 3.7 Inspect convolution layers and evaluate model
