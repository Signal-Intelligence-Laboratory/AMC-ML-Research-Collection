This collection is united by a direct line to the proposed final project.

The proposed final project is specifically a test of convolutional neural networks for automatic modulation parameter detection. The testing includes questions regarding the training itself, the flexibility of these systems, and also their resilience to adversaries. As such, all works in this collection will have some relation to these goals.

Folders:
creation_resources is for any resources found to aid in creation of neural networks for modulation recognition

the_literature is a collection of literature relating to RFML studies, with provided notes

a subfolder within the_literature is literature_rev_2-20 which is a quick writeup of the proposed direction of the project as of February 20th, 2025.

Any research which was compiled to get to this end goal but is not related is located in a subfolder of the_literature, entitled later_reference.
